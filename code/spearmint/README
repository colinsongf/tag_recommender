Description: 	Included in this directory is a collection of modules and scripts that
				can be used to language-process, dimensionality-prune, correlate,
				and predict tags for StackOverflow posts provided by `Train.csv` and
				`Test.csv`

Dependencies:

	Python==2.7
	nltk
		WordNet corpora downloaded with nltk.download()
	gensim
	cython
	numpy
	IPython
	spearmint

Instructions:

------------------------------------------------------------
Verify that the following directory structure is correct:

fb_recruit
	-> code
		-> lib
		-> spearmint
	-> data
	-> working

Also, copy the provided `spearmint.zip` into your local site-packages directory for
the local modified spearmint code. If you want to test-drive spearmint, then un-zip
it and place it into the same directory as this README file.
------------------------------------------------------------

In the preceding directory, run the code blocks within `process_and_prune.ipynb`:

	cd ..; ipython notebook --pylab inline

You may optionally build the recommender correlation dictionaries from within ipython
notebook, or you can manually do so by envoking the following script within the
preceding directory:

	python -c "import build_dicts"

Once the data have been pre-processed and pruned (for faster [but less accurate]
prediction time), run the code in the current directory (spearmint):

	ipcluster start -n 2 & # or 4 if you have > 16 GB memory
	python main.py --driver=local --method=GPEIChooser --method-args=noiseless=0
		config.pb

Spearmint will then run until either EOF is reached or is interrupted.

	<ctrl + d> or <ctrl + c>

Finally, within the same shell, turn off the IPython cluster with:

	ipcluster stop
